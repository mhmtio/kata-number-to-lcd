# kata-number-to-lcd

Inspired by https://github.com/codingdojo-org/codingdojo.org/blob/master/content/kata/NumberToLCD.md

Prints integers as LCD numbers, e.g.:

```
     _   _       _ 
  |  _|  _| |_| |_ 
  | |_   _|   |  _|
```

And supports different sizes, e.g. size 2 etc.:

```
                                      
          __      __              __  
    |       |       |    |  |    |    
    |     __|     __|    |__|    |__  
    |    |          |       |       | 
    |    |__      __|       |     __| 

```

Note: All LCD numbers are generated in size 1 first and then resized if needed.
